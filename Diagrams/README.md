As of October 1, 2024 I am now only encouraging and supporting builds based on the Raspberry Pi Hat. If you are the adventurous type, you are still more than welcome to build a prototype system. I'm only maintaining that information here and the original videos on the prototype system so people can gather a better understanding of how things work at a low level. As time allows, I will be creating new videos related to builds based on the Raspberry Pi Hat.

**NOTE:** _While the name "Raspberry Pi" is used frequently here, please keep in mind that I am currently reworking the code so that this system is compatible with Raspberry Pi clones as well. It's no big secret, the Raspberry Pi drought caused a lot of clones to be created that actually out-perform the original at a lower price._
