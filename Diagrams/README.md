I'm really not good at diagrams because I can't seem to get a decent grip on those kinds of tools. Mainly because their component libraries always seem to never include all of the same components that I'm using. I'm still hunting around for something that will work for me and not require me to change any designs.

New additions here by [FireflySE](https://github.com/FireflySE) include **Still-Controller-and-Monitor-Schematic.png**, **Still-Monitor-and-Controller.fzz** _(Fritzing project file for building the prototype system)_ and **Gerber-PCB-RPI-Smart-Still-Hat.zip** _(to simplify assembly if the prototype system is too daunting)_.

Prepped and tested RPi Smart Still Hats, LIDAR Hydrometer Readers, and 3D printed parts may be ordered from the /3D-Models/ directory at https://panhandleponics.com/rpi-smart-still-controller-components/ if you'd like to save yourself some time or if you aren't comfortable with soldering and 3D printing.

**NOTE:** _Keep in mind that Fritzing doesn't include all of the same components that I use, so there have been some substitutions used. Be sure to keep this in mind and don't try to use things like a DHT22 in the place of a DS18B20, the code doesn't support a DHT22._
