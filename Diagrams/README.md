I'm really not good at diagrams because I can't seem to get a decent grip on those kinds of tools. Mainly because their component libraries always seem to never include all of the same components that I'm using. I'm still hunting around for something that will work for me and not require me to change any designs.

New additions here by FireflySE include **Still-Controller-and-Monitor-Schematic.png**, **Still-Monitor-and-Controller.fzz** (Fritzing project file for building the prototype system) and **Gerber-PCB-RPI-Smart-Still-Hat.zip** (to simplify assembly compared to the prototype system).

**NOTE:** _Keep in mind that Fritzing doesn't include all of the same components that I use, so there have been some substitutions used. Be sure to keep this in mind and don't try to use things like a DHT22 in the place of a DS18B20, the code doesn't support a DHT22._
