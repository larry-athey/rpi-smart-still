This is a 4-layer printed circuit board and is capable of running everything up through the Model 5 and its clones.

The issue with the logic level shifters in the v1.1 and v1.2 boards is fixed in this version.

As stated in the [Wiki](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still/wiki), this system will run perfectly fine on a Model 3 B+, even with a built-in screen and full desktop environment. A Model 4 will make a full desktop based system will provide a more responsive user interface, but a Model 5 is complete overkill and kind of a waste of such a high powered computer.
