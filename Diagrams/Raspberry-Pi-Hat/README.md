This is a 4-layer version of the RPi Hat by [FireflySE](https://github.com/FireflySE) of Sweden, and is capable of running everything up to a Model 5 and its clones. Depending on your location and where you get printed circuit boards made, the 2-layer version 1.3 boards could save you money over the price of the 4-layer version 1.4 boards. JLCPCB isn't an option for me in the USA with the surcharges that they add on for my location, so PCBway is cheaper for me even at their higher prices.

The issue with the logic level shifters in the v1.1 and v1.2 boards is fixed in this version.

As stated in the [Wiki](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still/wiki), this system will run perfectly fine on a Model 3 B+, even with a built-in screen and full desktop environment. A Model 4 will make a full desktop based system will provide a more responsive user interface, but a Model 5 is complete overkill and kind of a waste of such a high powered computer.
