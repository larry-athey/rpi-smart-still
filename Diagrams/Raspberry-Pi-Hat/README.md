If you are using a Raspberry Pi Model 5 or any clone of a Model 5, you will need to use this version of the Pi Hat due to their amount of current draw.

If you are using anything else up through the Model 4 or a clone of a Model 4, you can safely get by with the version 1.3 Pi Hat since they draw far less current.
