If you are using a Raspberry Pi Model 5 or any clone of a Model 5, you will need to use this version of the Pi Hat due to their amount of current draw.

If you are using anything else up through the Model 4 or a clone of a Model 4, you can safely get by with the version 1.3 Pi Hat since they draw far less current.

As stated in the [Wiki](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still/wiki), this system will run perfectly fine on a Model 3 B+, even with a built-in screen and full desktop environment. A Model 4 will make a full desktop based system will provide a more responsive user interface, but a Model 5 is complete overkill and kind of a waste of such a high powered computer.
