The issue with the logic level shifters in the v1.1 and v1.2 boards is fixed in this version.

Again, keep in mind that **MOST** L298N driver boards wlil work with 3.3 volt logic and the logic level shifters may not be necessary. You should test your driver boards to see if they only work with 5 volt logic.
