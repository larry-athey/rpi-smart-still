This version of the Pi Hat, modified and remixed by James (The Doc) of Ireland, is a 2-layer printed circuit board and is still capable of running everything up to a Model 5 and its clones. Depending on your location and where you get printed circuit boards made, the 2 layer version could save you money over the price of the 4-layer version 1.4 boards.

The issue with the logic level shifters in the v1.1 and v1.2 boards is fixed in this version.

Again, keep in mind that **MOST** L298N driver boards will work with 3.3 volt logic and the logic level shifters may not be necessary. You should test your driver boards to see if they only work with 5 volt logic. If they work with 3.3 volt logic, you can eliminate the logic level shifters and bypass them with jumpers.
