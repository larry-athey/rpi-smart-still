; RPi Smart Still Configuration File
; ----------------------------------
;
; Below are the GPIO pin assignments for a Raspberry Pi 40 pin GPIO bus and the
; serial port device for the hydrometer. You may notice that Raspberry Pi clones
; also have a 40 pin GPIO bus, but their GPIO pin numbers are all out of whack.
;
; For example, Raspberry Pi Hat auxilliary relay 1, connected to physical pin 11.
;
; Raspberry Pi = GPIO 17
; Banana Pi M2 Zero = GPIO 1
;
; If you are using a Banana Pi M2 Zero, change the RELAY1=17 below to RELAY1=1.
; You will need to reboot your device after making any changes to this file.
;
; As you now know, while a clone might look like a drop-in replacement for your
; Raspberry Pi, there are times where that actually is not the case. It's best
; to test your boards by toggling pins on and off at the command line and using
; a breakout board with LEDs (link below).

;
; Refer to the link below for controlling the GPIO bus at the command line, you
; can also use this method with any Raspberry Pi clone running Linux.
