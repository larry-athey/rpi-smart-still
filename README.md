# RPI-Smart-Still
Raspberry PI and Arduino/ESP32 powered smart still controller and monitor. Designed around the Still Spirits T-500 column and boiler, but can be easily added to any other custom built still.

Let me start off by saying that I'm no master distiller and don't pretend to be one. YouTube is already full of those kinds of frauds *(I'm talking about you Cyrus Mason Jar, Still'n The Clear poser)*. I'm a software engineer with a strong emphasis in the area of automation, I'm only a hobby distiller.

**This project is a work in progress and components of it will be uploaded here as I feel they are ready for prime-time.**

Currently doing physical design debugging of an ESP32 powered hydrometer that uses a reference weight suspended from a load cell in a miniature parrot-like vessel. The distillate proof changes the buoyancy of the reference weight and seems to be more accurate than the Arduino powered hydrometer, but still works out to be about the same price to build.
