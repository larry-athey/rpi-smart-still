# 3D Model Notes

As you can see by [the photo](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still/tree/main/Diagrams) of the four Raspberry Pi (and clones) in the Diagrams directory, the last one is a Model Zero style. If you are not using a Model Zero, you will need to clip off the center pair of mounting stand-offs from the **RPi + Hat Mounting Plate.stl** model.
