# 3D Model Notes

**34-Copper-flow-Sensor** - This folder contains models related to the [3/4" copper pipe flow sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXPyjsHgtic) designed by [James "The Doc"](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDocChannel) of Ireland. This includes the mounting arm that attaches to the center column of your parrot.

**Flow-Sensor-Bottom.stl** - This is the bottom part of the 3D printable flow sensor vessel that inserts into the 1-3/4" (35mm) receiver cup of your proofing parrot. This must be printed with PETG using 0.1mm layers due to the size of the weep holes in the stand pipe. Or, if you have an SLA resin printer, that would be better yet. Check your resin technical data to verify that it can stand up to ethanol.

**Flow-Sensor-Cap.stl** - This is the cap for the above mentioned flow sensor vessel. It is suggested that you print this using TPU so that it can expand while inserting the copper capactor plates and the DS18B20 temperature sensor. There is a 10mm hole to accept a small funnel to function as your condenser receiver or 1/4" ID silicone tubing from the output of a Still Spirits T500 column.

**Flow-Sensor-Plate-Spacer.stl** - This goes on the end of the copper capacitor plates inside the flow sensor vessel to prevent them from touching each other. This should also be printed with TPU so it's easier to insert the capacitor plates. The plates should reach all the way to the bottom of the vessel, cut two copper strips 55mm x 10mm and bend a 5mm tab at the top to solder the wires to.

**Hydrometer Reflector.stl** - This is the circular reflector that goes at the top of your hydrometer. You should print this in PLA using 0.1mm layers, this will only be two layers tall. While you could print this with a single 0.2mm layer, it will likely tear when you put it on your hydrometer. Depending on your hydrometer, you may need to slightly notch the center hole to make it fit.
